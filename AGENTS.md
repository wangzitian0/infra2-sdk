## Engineering discipline

- **Measure the physical system first.** Before an abstract architecture proposal, inspect the system with read-only probes such as `time cmd`, process chains, and file-descriptor locks. A conceptually neat story without physical evidence is insufficient. A probe must not write. Do not combine validation and action in one command: a POST permission probe can create a resource, and a trial commit can leave a real commit. Measure, read the result, then decide, with a stop point between these steps.
- **Green does not prove truth.** The tested system writes its own unit tests, CI, and issue states. Cross-check critical conclusions against two external sources not written by this repository.
- **Tests must be falsifiable.** Do not hide assertions in `if (exists)` or `if (code != 0)` so failures run zero assertions. Do not accept tautologies such as `typeof null === 'object'` or `result !== undefined || true`. Source-text `indexOf` matches against prose are not integration tests. Duplicate test function identifiers can silently shadow earlier tests (Python `def` and duplicate JS function/const/export names); duplicate string titles in `test()` or `it()` instead run both. A green count is not coverage evidence. Make a new test fail under a relevant mutation. A read-only reviewer treats such fake-test patterns as CRITICAL merge blockers.
- **One source of truth:** Keep one authoritative definition for each core fact. Repeated hardcoding and scattered configuration invite drift.
- **Clean up during migration:** After the new mechanism is live and equivalence is proved, remove its predecessor, obsolete files, and dead code in the same change. Define contracts first and derive CI from them.
- **Deletion can leave guards green and empty:** A guard for an old structure can stop checking anything after deletion. Check each guard and remove it or redirect it to the new structure; green tests alone do not prove safe deletion.
- **Define guard scope from what it must govern, not from today's passing tree.** Let the guard fail on existing violations, then repair them. A guard never seen failing is not yet evidence of protection.

## Delivery and merge

- **Fail fast left to right:** Put the cheapest and likeliest failure checks first.
- **Review standing authorization:** Resolve a review thread directly after independently verifying it is fixed or obsolete. Do not resolve actionable, ambiguous, or unverified feedback. Automated reviewers may read a redacted GitHub diff rather than source: GitHub can show `"Authorization": f"Bearer ******"` where source has `"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"`. Check source before judging a report. When a report is false, turn the concern into a falsifiable invariant test rather than merely dismissing it.
- **Weighted review gates:** Each repository defines its own severity weights and blocking thresholds. Read literal `severity: <level>` tags; do not infer severity from prose.
- **Merge when ready:** Once all merge conditions pass, merge and continue from the latest main rather than piling up divergent branches.
